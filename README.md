# WebGPU Compute Samples

Simple compute algorithms using WebGPU to use as learning from a CUDA
background.

## Samples

* SAXPY
* Matrix Multiplication (Naive and Tiled using Shared Memory)

## Run locally

* Using Node.js, run `npm start`.
* Open your browser to `localhost:3000/<sample.html>`, where `sample.html` should be replaced by the benchmark you with to run.

### Third Party Credits

* Uses [Simple NodeJS HTTP Server](https://github.com/iftee/simple-nodejs-http-server) for serving HTML and JS files.
* Uses [regular-table](https://github.com/finos/regular-table/) to display results
