Simple compute algorithms using WebGPU to use as learning from a CUDA
background.

## Samples

Uses [Simple NodeJS HTTP Server](https://github.com/iftee/simple-nodejs-http-server) for serving HTML and JS files.
The benchmark is built in order to experimentally confirm this assumption and also determine by how much WebGPU performance is superior to WebGL.
